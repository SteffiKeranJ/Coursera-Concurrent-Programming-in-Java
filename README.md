# Coursera-Concurrent-Programming-in-Java
Concurrent programming enables developers to efficiently and correctly mediate the use of shared resources in parallel programs.  By the end of this course, you will learn how to use basic concurrency constructs in Java such as threads, locks, critical sections, atomic variables, isolation, actors, optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections, as well as their theoretical foundations (e.g., progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability).
